## Background


## üíª Setup Environment

This guide is for setting up the Python development environment needed to 
develop the CLI which is where all of the code for the data transfer 
pipeline lives.

### Install Python

This project has been tested with Python 3.11. Since there are many versions
of Python being used for various projects in D3b, it is a good idea to use
[pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/) to manage python versions and
virtual environments.

Follow the [installation instructions here](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/#installing-pyenv)
to install pyenv.

Next install python using pyenv:

```shell
# install latest version of python 3.11
$ pyenv install -v 3.11.8
```

### Get Source Code

Time to get the source code, install the CLI as an editable Python
package, and install all of the necessary Python dependencies.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:d3b-center/d3b-data-transfer-pipeline.git
cd d3b-data-transfer-pipeline 
cd d3b-data-transfer-cli
```

### Setup virtualenv

Next we need to create an isolated environment for our dependencies. For this
we will use pyenv to create a virtualenv with the right version Python.

```shell
# create virtualenv using python 3.11
$ pyenv virtualenv 3.11.8 d3b-data-transfer-venv
```

```shell
# Activate the virtualenv
$ pyenv local d3b-data-transfer-venv
```

```shell
# Install required run dependencies
$ pip install -e .

# Install development and testing dependencies
$ pip install -r .[dev]
$ pip install -r '.[dev]' (if using zsh)
```

### Test Installation

Test that everything installed correctly by running the CLI help:

```shell
d3b --help
```

## ‚úÖ Tests

There are 2 types of tests that you can run locall and these same tests also run
in the Github workflow, which executes on every pushed commit to an **open** PR.

### Unit Tests

**Source Code: [tests/unit](../tests/unit)**

The unit tests try to test the various stages and functions of the pipeline
independently, and they also test the full pipeline pipeline but only with
local services.

### Integration Tests

**Source Code: [tests/integration](../tests/integration)**

Integration tests involve Dewrangle. There are tests which test individual
CLI cmds for interacting with Dewrangle.

## üö® Code Format and Style

To maintain code consistency and readability across our project, we use [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
a popular Python code formatter.
The formatter ensures that all Python files in our repository adhere to a uniform style,
minimizing the need for code style discussions during code reviews.

### Run Linter

We run the linter on the `d3b_data_transfer_cli` and the `tests` folders.

```bash
$black  --line-length 80 d3b_data_transfer_cli tests
```

You should see something like the following.

```text
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
2 files reformatted, 170 files left unchanged.
```
